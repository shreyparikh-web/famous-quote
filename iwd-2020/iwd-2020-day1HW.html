			<b><i><u>I have a dream</u></i></b> that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
			<br><br>
			<b><i><u>I have a dream</u></i></b> that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
			<br><br>
			<b><i><u>I have a dream</u></i></b> that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
			<br><br>
			<b><i><u>I have a dream</u></i></b> that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
			<br><br>
			<b><i><u>I have a dream</u></i></b> today!
			<br><br>
			<b><i><u>I have a dream</u></i></b> that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
